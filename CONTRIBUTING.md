We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition. 👏

## Instructions

These steps will guide you through contributing to this project:

- Fork the repo
- Clone it and install dependencies

      git clone https://github.com/jucian0/createform
      pnpm install

Keep in mind that after running `pnpm install` the git repo is reset. So a good way to cope with this is to have a copy of the folder to push the changes, and the other to try them.

Make and commit your changes. Make sure to use `pnpm commit`, and follow all commits steps.

## Docs

To run docs: `pnpm dev` `localhost:3000`

Finally send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/jucian0/createform/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of what you've done (read more [about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
