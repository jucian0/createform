# createForm API Reference

The `createForm` function is the heart of CreateForm library. Despite having a minimal API surface, it provides everything you need to build powerful, type-safe forms in React.

<Callout type="info">
**Philosophy**: CreateForm embraces simplicity without sacrificing functionality. Learn once, use everywhere.
</Callout>

## Function Signature

```typescript
function createForm<T extends Record<string, any>>(
  config: CreateFormConfig<T>
): () => CreateFormReturn<T>
```

Returns a custom React hook that manages your form state and provides all necessary form utilities.

---

## Configuration Options

### `initialValues` (required)

Define the initial state of your form fields. This object shapes your entire form structure.

<Tabs items={["Basic Usage", "Nested Objects", "Arrays", "TypeScript"]}>
<Tab>

```typescript copy
const useContactForm = createForm({
  initialValues: {
    name: "",
    email: "",
    message: "",
    newsletter: false,
  },
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```typescript copy
const useAddressForm = createForm({
  initialValues: {
    user: {
      firstName: "",
      lastName: "",
    },
    address: {
      street: "",
      city: "",
      country: "US",
    },
    preferences: {
      notifications: true,
      theme: "light",
    },
  },
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```typescript copy
const useSkillsForm = createForm({
  initialValues: {
    skills: [
      { name: "", level: "beginner" }
    ],
    projects: [],
    tags: ["react", "typescript"],
  },
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```typescript copy
interface UserForm {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
  preferences: {
    newsletter: boolean;
    theme: "light" | "dark";
  };
}

const useUserForm = createForm<UserForm>({
  initialValues: {
    name: "",
    email: "",
    age: 0,
    preferences: {
      newsletter: false,
      theme: "light",
    },
  },
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="tip">
**Best Practice**: Always provide `initialValues` to establish your form's schema and enable TypeScript inference.
</Callout>

---

### `validationSchema` (optional)

Provide schema-based validation using Zod, Yup, or custom validation functions.

<Tabs items={["Zod Schema", "Yup Schema", "Custom Function"]}>
<Tab>

```typescript copy
import { z } from "zod";

const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, "Name is required"),
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email format"),
  age: z.number().min(18, "Must be 18 or older"),
});

const useUserForm = createForm({
  initialValues: { name: "", email: "", age: 0 },
  validationSchema: userSchema,
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```typescript copy
import * as Yup from "yup";

const userSchema = Yup.object().shape({
  name: Yup.string().required("Name is required"),
  email: Yup.string().email("Invalid email"),
  age: Yup.number().min(18, "Must be 18+"),
});

const useUserForm = createForm({
  initialValues: { name: "", email: "", age: 0 },
  validationSchema: userSchema,
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```typescript copy
const validateUser = (values) => {
  const errors = {};
  
  if (!values.name) {
    errors.name = "Name is required";
  }
  
  if (!values.email?.includes("@")) {
    errors.email = "Invalid email format";
  }
  
  return errors;
};

const useUserForm = createForm({
  initialValues: { name: "", email: "" },
  validationSchema: validateUser,
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### `mode` (optional)

Control when validation occurs. Default: `"onChange"`.

```typescript copy
type ValidationMode = "onChange" | "onBlur" | "onSubmit";

const useForm = createForm({
  initialValues: { email: "" },
  mode: "onBlur", // Validate when field loses focus
});
```

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `onChange` | Validate on every input change | Real-time feedback |
| `onBlur` | Validate when field loses focus | Less intrusive validation |
| `onSubmit` | Validate only on form submission | Performance-critical forms |

---

### `debounce` (optional)

Debounce validation to improve performance with expensive validation logic.

```typescript copy
const useSearchForm = createForm({
  initialValues: { query: "" },
  validationSchema: expensiveValidationSchema,
  mode: "onChange",
  debounce: 300, // Wait 300ms after user stops typing
});
```

---

### `initialErrors` (optional)

Pre-populate the form with error messages (useful for server-side validation).

```typescript copy
const useForm = createForm({
  initialValues: { name: "", email: "" },
  initialErrors: {
    name: "Name is required",
    email: "Email format is invalid",
  },
});
```

---

### `initialTouched` (optional)

Pre-set which fields have been interacted with by the user.

```typescript copy
const useForm = createForm({
  initialValues: { name: "", email: "" },
  initialTouched: {
    name: true,  // Show validation errors immediately
    email: false, // Don't show errors until user interacts
  },
});
```

### yourHookForm

This is a hook that should be used inside a functional component, this hook provides resources that you need to manager forms, let all of them:

- **`form`** - This property is an observable of the form, it allows you to subscribe and watch every change that happens inside the form, or change the form state.

- **`register()`** - `register` is a function that is used to register an input into the form. It is used to get the properties required to render a form field, such as the ref, `onBlur`, and `onChange` handlers. The function accepts either an object with properties of the field to be registered, or a string name of the field. The properties for the field can include the name, type, placeholder, and validation function. The function returns an object with the properties for the field that can be used to render the form field component.

  ```jsx copy
  return (
    <input
      {...register({
        name: "username",
        type: "text",
        placeholder: "Enter your username",
      })}
    />
  );
  ```

- **`setFieldValue()`** - This function is typically used in the context of a form. It allows you to set the value of a specific field in the form. This can be useful for pre-populating form fields with default values, or for programmatically setting the value of a field based on the user's input in other fields. For example, if you have a form with a field for the user's first and last name, example: `setFieldError("name","Jesse")`.

- **`setFieldsValue()`** - function is similar to the `setFieldValue` function, but it allows you to set the values of multiple fields in a form at once. This can be useful for pre-populating a form with default values, or for programmatically setting the values of multiple fields based on the user's input in other fields. For example, if you have a form with fields for the user's first and last name, you could use setFieldsValue to set the values of both fields at the same time. This would ensure that the form always contains the most up-to-date values based on the user's input.

  ```jsx copy
  const { setFieldValues } = yourHookForm();

  setFieldsValue({
    name: "Jesse",
    lastName: "...",
  });

  //or

  setFieldsValue((state) => ({
    ...state,
    lastName: "...",
  }));
  ```

- **`setFieldError()`** - This function is typically used in a form validation context. It allows you to set an error message for a specific field in a form. This is useful for providing feedback to the user about what went wrong with their input. For example, if a user enters an invalid email address, you could use setFieldError to set the error message for the email field to something like `setFieldError("email","Please enter a valid email address.")` This error message would then be displayed to the user so that they know what they need to fix in order to successfully submit the form.

- **`setFieldsError()`** - This function is similar to the `setFieldError` function, but it allows you to set error messages for multiple fields in a form at once. This can be useful for providing feedback to the user about any errors in their input. For example, if a user submits a form with multiple invalid fields, you could use setFieldsError to set the error messages for all of the invalid fields at the same time. This would allow the user to easily see all of the errors in their input and correct them before resubmitting the form.

  ```jsx copy
  const { setFieldsError } = yourHookForm();

  setFieldsError({
    name: "Invalid name!",
    lastName: "This field is required!",
  });

  //or

  setFieldsError((state) => ({
    ...state,
    lastName: "This field is required!",
  }));
  ```

- **`setFieldTouched()`** - It is a function that allows you to mark a specific field as "touched", which means that the field has been interacted with by the user. This is often used in conjunction with form validation, as it allows you to only validate fields that have been touched by the user. For example, if you have a required field in a form that the user has not interacted with, you could use setFieldTouched to mark the field as touched before running the validation. This would ensure that the validation checks the field and displays an error message if the field is empty, example: `setFieldTouched("name",true)`.

- **`setFieldsTouched()`** - The setFieldsTouched function is similar to the `setFieldTouched` function, but it allows you to mark multiple fields as "touched" at the same time. This can be useful for ensuring that all relevant fields in a form are validated, even if the user has not directly interacted with all of them. For example, if you have a form with multiple required fields, you could use setFieldsTouched to mark all of the required fields as touched before running the validation. This would ensure that all of the required fields are checked and that any empty fields display an error message to the user.

  ```jsx copy
  const { setFieldsError } = yourHookForm();

  setFieldsTouched({
    name: true,
    lastName: false,
  });

  //or

  setFieldsTouched((state) => ({
    ...state,
    lastName: false,
  }));
  ```

- **`reset()`** - It allows you to reset the form to its initial, unmodified state. This can be useful for clearing all of the user's input and starting over, or for resetting the form after a successful submission. For example, if the user submits a form and the submission is successful, you could use the reset function to clear all of the form fields and reset any error messages or validation states. This would allow the user to start fresh and enter new data into the form.

- **`resetValues()`** - The resetValues function is similar to the reset function, but it only resets the values of the form fields, and not their error messages or validation states. This can be useful for clearing the user's input from the form without resetting the form's validation state. For example, if the user submits a form and the submission is successful, you could use the resetValues function to clear all of the form fields without resetting any error messages or validation states. This would allow the user to start fresh and enter new data into the form, while still displaying any existing error messages or validation errors.

- **`resetErrors()`** - The resetErrors function is similar to the reset function, but it only resets the error messages of the form fields, and not their values or validation states. This can be useful for clearing any existing error messages from the form without resetting the form's values or validation state. For example, if the user submits a form and the submission is successful, you could use the resetErrors function to clear all of the error messages from the form fields without resetting the values or validation state. This would allow the user to start fresh and enter new data into the form, while still retaining any existing values and validation errors.

- **`resetTouched()`** - The resetTouched function is similar to the reset function, but it only resets the "touched" state of the form fields, and not their values, error messages, or validation states. This can be useful for resetting the "touched" state of the form fields without resetting any other aspects of the form. For example, if the user submits a form and the submission is successful, you could use the resetTouched function to reset the "touched" state of all of the form fields without resetting their values, error messages, or validation states. This would allow the user to start fresh and enter new data into the form, while still retaining any existing values, error messages, and validation errors.

- **`handleSubmit()`** - It is a method that is called when the user submits the form. This function is responsible for performing any necessary form validation and handling the form submission. For example, when the user clicks the "Submit" button on a form, the handleSubmit function would be called. This function would then run the form validation to ensure that all of the required fields are filled out and that the user's input is valid. If the validation is successful, the handleSubmit function would handle the form submission, typically by sending the form data to a server for processing. If the validation fails, the handleSubmit function would typically display error messages to the user so that they can fix any issues with their input before resubmitting the form.

  ```jsx copy
  const Form = () => {
    const { handleSubmit } = yourHookForm();

    function handleOnSubmit(e) {
      mutation(e);
    }

    return (
      <form onsubmit={handleSubmit(handleOnSubmit)}>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  };
  ```

- **`state`** - This object contains information about the values of the form fields, their error messages, their validation states, and other metadata about the form. The formState object is typically used to populate the form fields and display any validation errors or other feedback to the user.

  ```jsx copy
  const { state } = yourHookForm();
  const { values, errors, touched } = state;
  ```

- **`isValid`** - it is a variable that determines if the form is valid ot not.
