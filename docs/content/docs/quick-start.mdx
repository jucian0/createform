Welcome to CreateForm! 🚀

Let's get you building powerful React forms in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through the essentials to get your first form up and running.

## Description

Forms are an important element of a website because they allow users to interact with the website and provide input or information. Forms are often used for a variety of purposes, such as logging in to an account, creating a new account, submitting a search query, placing an order, and many other purposes.

One of the key benefits of using forms on a website is that they allow users to provide specific information or input that can be processed and used by the website. For example, a login form allows users to provide their username and password, which can then be validated and used to grant the user access to their account. A search form allows users to provide a query, which can then be used by the website to return relevant results.

In addition to providing a way for users to interact with a website, forms are also an important tool for gathering information from users. This information can be used to improve the website, provide personalized experiences, and help businesses make better decisions.

Overall, forms are an essential element of most websites and play a crucial role in enabling user interaction and gathering information.

When we think about forms, react hooks are a game-changer, because they simplify the process of creating forms and don't require libraries.  
However, if you want to build forms with nested fields and validations, it is better to use a library, and you can find a lot of libraries on internet, so, why another one?

### Reasons to use Createform

There are several motivations for using a custom form hook created by `createForm` in a React application. Some of these motivations include:

- **Reusability**: One of the main benefits of using a custom form hook created by `createForm` is that it allows you to reuse the same form logic across multiple components in your application. This means that you don't have to write the same form handling code multiple times, which can save you time and make your code more organized and maintainable.

- **Flexibility**: A custom form hook created by `createForm` allows you to customize the behavior of your forms and define exactly how they should work. This can be useful if you have specific requirements for your forms, such as validating user input or submitting the form data to an API.

- **Simplicity**: Using a custom form hook created by `createForm` can make it easier to work with forms in your React application. By abstracting away the details of form handling, you can focus on the core logic of your application and avoid getting bogged down in the complexities of form management.

- **Separation of concerns**: A custom form hook created by `createForm` allows you to separate the concerns of form handling and data management from the rest of your application. This can make it easier to test and maintain your code, as well as improve the overall organization and structure of your application.

### So, why Createform?

There are some reasons why you face problems when you want to create forms, and with Createform, you can solve these problems.

- **State management** - A couple of years ago, you could think that Redux or
  MobX was a the best solution to manage form state in react, and they were, but not anymore. Today
  you can use hooks to manage the form state, hooks like `useStatew` and
  `useReducer` are a good solution to manage the state. But managing values,
  touched fields and errors could be a problem if you don't have a standard way to
  manage them. Usually, real applications use nested objects as request payloads,
  and you should keep it to send the correct data to the server, manage nested
  values and errors could be a problem using just `useState` and `useReducer`.

- **Errors** - To deal with errors, you can use your validation solution, and it can
  work well with simple forms, but you can stuck with a lot of errors when you
  have nested fields.

- **Touched fields** - Maybe you want to show a message error
  just when the field is touched, so in order to do that you need to manage the
  touched fields, it can be really easy to do with `useState` and `useReducer`,
  but you can't do that very well with `useState` and `useReducer` when you have
  nested fields.

- **Handle submit** - When you want to handle submit, you need to
  manage the submit event, it's convenient when you have an already solution to do
  that.

Createform provides a way to create complex forms easily, this hook returns an object
of values ​​in the same shape that it receives, this is possible using dot notation.
Therefore, it does not matter if the object is complex or has many properties or
an array, the result is the same. This process turns very easy to create forms from
nested objects, the same layers and properties are replicated in the final object,
this approach prevents you to type more code to convert an object from form to backend
object type. The same process is realized with errors objects and touched objects.

## What to expect with Createform

- **Performer forms** - Createform provides a way to complete a form and submit it without any rerender, by default Createform creates uncontrolled forms.
- **Easy to write** - Createform has an easy way to write forms with less code. register function return necessary input's properties and it is all we need to manage all events in a native HTML `input`. Writhe forms without form tag.
- **Easy validation** - By default Createform uses yup validation, we can write complex validation without effort.

## Installation

Install CreateForm using your preferred package manager:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
<Tab>
```bash copy
npm install @createform/react
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash copy
yarn add @createform/react
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash copy
pnpm add @createform/react
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash copy
bun add @createform/react
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Your First Form

CreateForm offers two approaches. Let's start with the simplest one:

### Option 1: useForm() - The Simple Way

Perfect for straightforward forms with minimal setup:

```tsx copy
import { useForm } from "@createform/react";

function LoginForm() {
  const { register } = useForm({
    initialValues: { email: "", password: "" },
    onSubmit: (data) => {
      console.log("Form submitted:", data);
      // Handle your form submission here
    },
  });

  return (
    <form {...register()}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
        <input 
          id="email"
          name="email" 
          type="email" 
          placeholder="your@email.com" 
        />
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        <input 
          id="password"
          name="password" 
          type="password" 
          placeholder="••••••••" 
        />
      </div>
      
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Option 2: createForm() - The Powerful Way

For complex forms that you want to reuse across components:

```tsx copy
import { createForm } from "@createform/react";

// 1. Create your custom form hook
const useLoginForm = createForm({
  initialValues: { 
    email: "", 
    password: "" 
  },
});

// 2. Use it in your component
function LoginForm() {
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useLoginForm();

  function onSubmit(data) {
    console.log("Form submitted:", data);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <input 
        type="email" 
        placeholder="Email"
        {...register("email")} 
      />
      <input 
        type="password" 
        placeholder="Password"
        {...register("password")} 
      />
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Adding Validation

Let's add some validation to make your forms robust:

```tsx copy
import { createForm } from "@createform/react";
import { z } from "zod"; // You can also use Yup

// Define your validation schema
const loginSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Please enter a valid email"),
  password: z.string().min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters"),
});

const useLoginForm = createForm({
  initialValues: { email: "", password: "" },
  validationSchema: loginSchema,
  mode: "onChange", // Validate as user types
});

function LoginForm() {
  const { register, handleSubmit, state } = useLoginForm();
  const { errors, touched } = state;

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(console.log)}>
      <div>
        <input 
          type="email" 
          placeholder="Email"
          {...register("email")} 
        />
        {touched.email && errors.email && (
          <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>{errors.email}</span>
        )}
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <input 
          type="password" 
          placeholder="Password"
          {...register("password")} 
        />
        {touched.password && errors.password && (
          <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>{errors.password}</span>
        )}
      </div>
      
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
